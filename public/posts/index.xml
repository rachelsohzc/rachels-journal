      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been counting down the days for this for almost six months, and now it&amp;rsquo;s finally happening - I&amp;rsquo;m moving into my own place for the first time!&#xA;Having my own space has always meant a lot to me because I can do anything and absolutely anything to my space. And for some reason, it also makes me feel more confident to face life as authentically as possible.&#xA;As I write this, I moved out of my old place one week ago where I used to live with my flatmate.</description>
