      <p>I turn 24 this year, and I&rsquo;d like to say that I am almost at level 3 (aka year 3) of this game called adulthood. I&rsquo;ve weathered through my first quarter-life crisis. I still don&rsquo;t have everything figured out, but I want to share my story.</p>
<h4 id="how-it-started">HOW IT STARTED</h4>
<p>I started my first job away from London, where I did my Bachelor&rsquo;s. When I landed my job, you could say I shed blood, sweat, and tears because I thought this was the path to my perfect life. A few months in, I switched gears to autopilot because I felt so numb every day. I couldn&rsquo;t express how I felt in words. Instead, there would be random nights where I would burst into tears without knowing why.</p>
<p>I reached my breaking point after a series of events.</p>
<p>It started with a road trip to Switzerland with my friends. We had a bit of a road accident, and my friend struck something in me when he asked if I was okay. I was confused because I thought I was perfectly fine, but he mentioned that he had never before seen me so desensitised to my surroundings.</p>
<p>Not long after Switzerland, I had to deal with an end to a situationship.</p>
<p>Going through all the emotions, I think one common factor kept popping up. I was avoiding something - I suppressed my frustrations when I did things that weren&rsquo;t in tune with what I truly wanted to do in life. I didn&rsquo;t tell my friends and family what I was going through and insisted that this was my problem alone to fix. I avoided being alone with my thoughts as much as I could.</p>
<p>Even though I couldn&rsquo;t pinpoint what was wrong, I knew one thing -  I was extremely unhappy with my life.</p>
<h4 id="self-growth">SELF-GROWTH</h4>
<p>I want to use this quote my dad always tells me when I come to him with life problems before talking about what I&rsquo;ve learned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happiness takes a lot of effort. No one is magically happy. You have a choice - either put in the effort and live a meaningful life, or take the easy way out and wonder about the what ifs when you&rsquo;re on your death bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of these lessons would&rsquo;ve mattered if I wasn&rsquo;t willing to put in the work.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: Listen to your emotions</p>
<p>Ignoring my emotions made me switch to living life on autopilot. Often, the more we suppress our feelings, the more they try to be heard.</p>
<p>I wanted to document my life, whether it was through videos, blogs, or pictures. But I didn&rsquo;t because I was worried I would look like a cringy influencer. I started to plan for the future as if I wanted to settle down and buy a house to live in for the rest of my life with a partner. It&rsquo;s something society often expects you to do. But I don&rsquo;t even want to do that. The very thought of that makes me squirmish.</p>
<p>Acknowledge those feelings, even if they&rsquo;re unconventional. They&rsquo;ll lead and guide you to what you want to do.</p>
<p>Lesson 2: Have uncomfortable conversations</p>
<p>Uncomfortable conversations include ugly thoughts and admitting things you don&rsquo;t want to believe about yourself.</p>
<p>For a couple of months, whenever I felt frustrated or upset, I would get out my phone and record myself talking. I would then watch back those videos and pretend to be a third party watching this girl talk about her life. As I listened to this girl talk about her life, I wondered why she kept crying about her dissatisfaction with her job role and loneliness as if she was powerless to change things. That&rsquo;s when I realised that I had gotten comfortable acting like a victim in any unfortunate scenario I found myself in.</p>
<p>From there, I started actively seeking projects that interested me at work, forced myself to go to dance classes despite being scared (I&rsquo;ve wanted to dance for ages, but I&rsquo;ve always been worried about looking stiff and stupid), and became the friend who would reach out to organise things like board games night.</p>
<p>Admitting that you&rsquo;re a blocker to your own goals can make you more open to change because once you&rsquo;ve realised your mistakes, the only next step is &ldquo;How can I improve and do better for myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lesson 3:</p>
<p>Lesson 4: Putting in the effort makes a huge difference</p>
