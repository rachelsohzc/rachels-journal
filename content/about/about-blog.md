Hello! I'm Rachel - thanks for stopping by!

I started this blog to share my stories and connect with others who might be going through similar experiences. It's also for my friends who kept asking me to write about my travels â€“ well, here it is! Finally, a place where you can read about all my adventures c:

A bit about me: I love photography, cooking, dancing, writing, traveling, and diving into deep topics that make me reflect on life. You'll find all these things (and more) in the posts I share here. I hope at least one of them makes you chuckle or leaves you with a fresh perspective (otherwise I have failed).

Enjoy!
